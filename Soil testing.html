<p>Making the most of it can seem daunting, especially when there is a wealth of scientific information about it. Honestly, it's about getting the basics right. Understanding your soil means looking at its mineral, structural and biological health-a problem with any of these factors can cause major issues for you and your farm. Knowing what soil you have and what state it's in can give you the knowledge to make good decisions for your business.</p>
<h3> <b>Different techniques- what to use when</b></h3>
<p>The GREATsoils team have reviewed the different ways you can assess your soil health. Some are very simple while others involve expensive testing under laboratory conditions. All of them can tell you something about your soil, but you have to make best use of that information to ensure the test was worthwhile. What you choose depends on your situation, inclination and budget. If you haven’t tested your soil for a while, do the basics first. Get a simple soil analysis, then get out and dig some holes – they’re both cheap to do and you can learn so much.</p>
