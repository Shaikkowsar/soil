<center><b>working with living soils</b> 
<p>We are quickly learning what we need to do to improve soil health and function. Key to this is a better understanding of soil biology and how our practices interact with the fauna and flora in our soils.</p>
<p>Organic matter consists of living and dead material, both of which are vital to soil functioning. Reliance on inorganic inputs and limited crop returns to soil means that in many areas, we are seeing a decline in levels of Soil Organic Matter (SOM).</p><br><br>
<p>Organically-managed soils and farmland can maintain soil fertility, enhance biodiversity and improve<span style="color:skyblue"><u> water retention capacity.</span></u> It can even be part of the solution to mitigate climate change through <span style="color:skyblue"><u>increased soil carbon sequestration.</span></u></p>
<p>The Soil Association vision is that soils must be living entities, full of organisms that are essential to maintaining productive capacity. Every farm has different soil types, and an understanding of how to manage your own is key to maintaining their health and productivity. Best management practices will vary depending on soil type but getting it right shouldnâ€™t only be seen as a challenge. Custodians of healthy soils will see benefits for their business, and will be recognised by a society that increasingly acknowledges the value of healthy soil.</p>
